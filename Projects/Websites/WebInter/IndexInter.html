        <p><b>To achieve a cleaner transport sector, a combination of measures must be implemented world-wide: better-designed cities; non-motorized transport facilities; more public transport; and cleaner and more efficient on-road fleets, including electric vehicles.</b>

            <br><b>As part of our commitment to sustainability and the environment, and as an effective way to fight climate change, InterEnergy promotes the transition toward sustainable mobility and the electrification of transport.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Today, transport contributes approximately one-quarter of all energy related carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. With transport, growing faster than any other sector, it is set to reach one-third of all energy emissions by [when?]. The global 
            passenger car fleet is projected to double by 2050. The majority of this growth is taking place in developing markets, where an estimated three out of four cars will be found. Yet, while developing countries have the fastest
             growing fleets, most have no vehicle emissions standards, programs or incentives in place to promote zero emission vehicles. In most developing countries the conversation around zero emission vehicles hasn’t even started yet.

            To achieve a cleaner transport sector, a combination of measures must be implemented world-wide: better-designed cities; non-motorized transport facilities; more public transport; and cleaner and more efficient on-road fleets, including electric vehicles.

            At InterEnergy, we are convinced of the role we must play as a company, in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and that is why we are committed to the decarbonization of transport through electric mobility.

            <b>What Would Happen If All Cars Were Electric? </b>
            <br>
            <br>
            What if all cars switched to electric overnight? In a recent conference  paper looking at the emissions impact for such a switch in the UK, for example, if all cars in the UK went entirely electric, the country’s total carbon emissions would be cut by almost 12%.
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s a hypothetical scenario, but not total fantasy. The public and private sectors all around the world need to work together to make this happen. Car makers are taking a stance — the switch from gas to electric is part of an industry-wide effort to contribute fewer emissions. At least 10 automakers are promising to make only electric options in the coming years, with the earliest transitions slated  for 2025. And countries and cities are also setting dates to go all electric.

            <br>
            But fewer emissions is only one of the benefits of electric vehicles which translates into health and environment benefits. EVs produce hardly any noise, so we will benefit from a decrease of noise pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), noise contamination is one of the environmental factors that causes more health problems. In Europe alone, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA), it causes 16,600 premature deaths and more than 72,000 hospitalizations per year.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another great advantage of electric vehicles is that they have almost 90% fewer mechanical pieces, which means fewer visits to t        
            <br>
             As part of our commitment to sustainability and the environment, and as an effective way to fight climate change, InterEnergy wants to promote and lead the transition towards sustainable mobility and the electrification of transport.

            <b>Some of the actions we have taken:</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            •	We are changing our car fleet to electric (we have changed 50% of the fleet in one our companies so far)
            <br>
            •	We have deployed the most advanced and sophisticated platform for charging stations for electric vehicles in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Jamaica (more than 250 charging stations installed)
            <br>
            •	We have joined the EV100 Initiative, a global initiative from the Climate Group which brings together companies committed to switching their fleets to electric vehicles and installing charging infrastructure for employees and customers by 2030.
